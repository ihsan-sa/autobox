description: Make a short, scripted demo video of a project from fake data, headless - a web UI filmed in Chromium with a drawn cursor and a camera that zooms and swoops, and a real terminal (tmux and bash in a sandboxed made-up workspace) recorded and replayed sharply at 1080p. Use it whenever someone asks for a demo video, product video, screencast, walkthrough clip, GIF of an app or terminal, or a README or social clip of a project. Never records a real screen, a real account or a real person's data.

# Demo video

A film is a script, not a recording session. You seed fake data, start a throwaway server or workspace, and write
the moves; the kit films them frame by frame and encodes each beat as a clip, the clips cut together into one MP4.
The page runs on a virtual clock that moves one frame at a time (30 fps, or 60 with `fps: 60`), so every CSS
animation, transition, rAF loop, timer, scroll and typed key moves exactly one frame's worth a frame, and the film
comes out the same however loaded the box is; a loaded box only makes the render slower. Each frame is captured at
2x, and the camera, the cursor and the click ring are drawn over it afterwards, so a zoom has real detail and the
cursor moves on every frame. Nothing real may be in frame: every beat checks the visible text against a list of denied words
(the host name, the user, the git identity, real project names) and fails when one shows.

## The pace

- About 20 s a film and never over 30 (`checkLength` fails a longer one; `DEMO_LONG=1` lets one through on purpose).
- Three to five beats, each one idea, cut hard into the next (`stitch` with no fade). Crossfade only into an end card.
- Show the thing working in the first 2 s. No title card up front.
- Hold a result at least 0.8 s (`d.show()`, which refuses less). That is a floor for a result, not the pace: the
  moves between results are quick, a cursor move 0.2-0.5 s, typing about 30 keys a second.
- One camera move a beat, zoom 1.5-2.2x (`d.camera`), eased in and out over 0.4-0.7 s. Zoom onto the result, not
  onto the cursor's travel. A swoop between two far places is `dip: 0.3`.
- Captions are optional. When the pictures say it, leave them out; when a beat needs one, keep it to one short line.
- 1920x1080 H.264, yuv420p, faststart, 30 fps (60 with `fps: 60`). A page laid out for 1280x720 is filmed at a
  1920x1080 viewport with `zoom: 1.5`.

## Files

- `film.mjs`: `director(page, {frames, deny, zoom, fps = 30, scale = 2})`, made before the page's first `goto` so
  its clock is in before the page's scripts, gives `beat`, `moveTo`, `click`, `type`, `press`, `scrollTo`, `drag`,
  `camera`, `show`, `hold`, `wait`, `cut`/`roll` (take a slow stretch out), `stop`, `beats()`. Film time passes only
  inside those calls and the kit's `sleep`, one captured frame per 1/fps; outside a beat they run in real time.
  - A page call that takes page time (typing inside the page, a terminal replay, an animation you await) goes
    through `await d.wait(page.evaluate(...))`, which films until it settles. Awaited bare, the clock would sit
    still; after 1.5 s the kit runs it anyway and warns at the beat's end, and that stretch's length then depends
    on the box.
  - `beat()` takes no frame until the first call that takes time, so `d.camera(view, {ms: 0})` right after it is in
    force from the beat's first frame. `camera` never moves the page, so boxes, the cursor and clicks stay in the
    same pixels whatever it does.
  - The cursor moves like a hand: slow off, quick in the middle, settling, along a slight arc, and a far reach takes
    longer than a near one (`reachMs`). `page.mouse.down()` from the script also spreads the click ring.
  - Then `await encodeClip` per beat: a compositor page draws each frame with the camera, cursor and ring, and
    ffmpeg encodes that image sequence once at `-framerate`, near lossless, with the caption strip when there is
    one. `stitch` is the one final encode. Also `encodeFrames` (stills with their own durations, resampled onto
    exact frames), `checkLength`, `toGif` and `contactSheet`.
- `camera.mjs`: the camera's maths (`cameraAt`, `viewFor`), pure, shared by the director, the selfcheck and the
  composition: the centre eases along a line, the scale in log space, `dip` pulls back mid-move.
- `term.mjs`: `recordTerminal({out, home, user, host, bins, script, deny})` runs tmux and bash for real in a
  bubblewrap sandbox: your made-up home at /home/<user>, a made-up host name, a passwd that knows only that user, a
  clean environment. The script types (`run`, `type`, `keys`), splits panes (`split`) and drops `mark`s. Then
  `terminalPage(cast, {dir, width, height, font})` writes a page that replays it with xterm.js; in it
  `player.seek(mark)`, `player.play(from, to, {speed, idle})` and `player.rect(mark, pane)` for the camera.
- `record.py`: the pty recorder behind `recordTerminal` (asciicast v2, with marks).
- `deps.mjs`: playwright-core and @xterm/xterm (`PINS`), installed once into ~/.cache/demo-video
  (`DEMO_NODE_MODULES` to use another node_modules), and the Chromium in ~/.cache/ms-playwright (`CHROME` to name
  another), which films the page and composites the frames.
- `selfcheck.mjs`: `node selfcheck.mjs` checks the kit without a browser, `motion/` included (its pieces are
  rendered to markup with react-dom/server); `--film` also films a moving page (a
  moving element and the cursor must advance on every output frame, timestamps must be exact, a zoom must not pop)
  and a tiny sandboxed terminal. `director()` runs the plain selfcheck first, once per render, and refuses to film
  if it fails; nothing in it depends on the box's load.
- `motion/`: the kit for a drawn film, where the UI is drawn rather than filmed (a chat window, an app rebuilt in its own
  look, a product shot). Each frame is a pure function of its time, rendered by Remotion, so it is
  frame-exact like a filmed beat. `motion.mjs` is the maths: one easing family (`EASE.out` for entrances, `inOut`
  for moves, `snap` for a hard return), `spring` (critically damped by default, so nothing bounces),
  `typed`, `ripple`, `drift` (a hand-held sway under 0.2 px a frame), `cameraKeys`, `blurTimes` and `frameTravel`
  for motion blur, `rng` for seeded randomness. `pieces.mjs` is the React pieces built on it, made with
  `pieces(React)` so no bundler is needed to check them: `Ripple` (a touch: ring and press dot, never a cursor or a
  hand), `MessageIn` (a list item that opens its height and
  rises in, its blur gone before the still tail so it never pops), `Typed`, `Camera` (with `depth` for parallax and `driftAmp`), `MotionBlur` (n samples across a
  180-degree shutter; give n = 1 when the move is slow) and `Crossfade` (each side its own stacking context, so a
  z-index inside the outgoing shot never paints over the incoming one). `render.mjs` renders it: `renderFilm`
  (lossless PNG frames, one H.264 yuv420p encode, faststart), `renderStills`, and `frameCost`, which times a
  stretch so you can pick 30 or 60 fps from what the box can do now. `measure.mjs` makes "no stutter" a number:
  `frameDiffs(mp4)` and `stutters(diffs)`, the frames that froze in the middle of a move. `sound.mjs` is the film's
  sound effects, synthesized, so no recording and no licence: `mix(cues, {dur})` places its voices (a tap, a key,
  typing, a message, a whoosh for a camera move, a rise into a 3D shot, a chord for the end) on their times, and
  `master` brings the mix to -16 LUFS under -1.5 dBTP (`lufs`, `tp`) and muxes it in as AAC, copying the video, then
  measures the AAC and encodes again until the AAC itself is in range. `score.mjs` is the
  background score and the mixing tools: notes rendered by a synthesized felt piano, pad and sub, a convolution room
  (`reverb`), a sidechain (`duck`), EQ, fades and `toLoudness`. `AUDIO.md` says how to score a film (the music carries
  it, a few soft touches under it) and how to mix and master it. Remotion and React are
  `MOTION_PINS` in `deps.mjs`, installed into the same cache on first use.
- `web-encode.sh`: the web copies of a finished film. `web-encode.sh mp4 IN OUT [CRF]` is a small H.264 for a page's
  video (CRF 24 by default, faststart), and `web-encode.sh gif IN OUT WIDTH FPS COLOURS [SS T]` a GIF with one palette
  and no dithering, which keeps a UI's flat colours clean; `web-encode.sh selfcheck` checks both.

## How to make one

1. Write the story in beats: what the viewer should see working, one idea each, 3-5 beats.
2. Make the fake world: seed data, a throwaway server on a free port, or a home directory for the terminal. Made-up
   people, domains and projects only.
3. Build the denied list from the real machine at run time (host, user, git name and e-mail, real project names), so
   no real value is ever written into the script.
4. Film: a 1920x1080 context, `director`, one `beat` per idea, `show()` on each result, `camera` onto it.
5. Encode, stitch, `checkLength`, and make a `contactSheet`. Look at the sheet before you call it done: it shows
   the pace, the framing and anything in frame that should not be.

## Blender shots

A shot that is modelled rather than filmed (a product turning, a logo, a 3D scene) is a Blender scene script: Python
that builds the whole scene from an empty file at render time, so it needs no .blend and renders the same under any
Blender version. `cc-suites render SCENE.py OUT [START END]` renders it with Cycles on the owner's laptop GPU and
brings the frames back into OUT; when the laptop is asleep, busy or has no GPU, the box renders it on its own CPU at
nice 19, slowly. Blender's log goes to OUT.log (and the laptop's to OUT.laptop.log when it fell back). Everything
in the scene's directory travels with it, so keep the scene in a directory of its own with only what it reads; a
scene in HOME or /tmp, or next to a .ssh or .cc, is refused. On the laptop it runs caged with no network; the box's
CPU fallback runs as you, with your environment and network, so render only a scene you wrote. Set the engine,
samples, resolution and file format in the script; cc-suites sets the output path, the frames and the device. Try it with
`cc-suites render blender/test-scene.py /tmp/frames` from this directory: two 320x180 frames in a few seconds.

## Needs

Node 18+, ffmpeg, python3, and for terminals tmux and bwrap. The first run installs the node modules (network once).
