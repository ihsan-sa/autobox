/* film.mjs (the demo-video skill) — what every demo video shares: a director that films a few short beats of a page
frame by frame, a cursor and a camera drawn over them, a check that nothing real is in frame, and the encode: each
beat a clip with its caption, the clips cut or crossfaded into one film, and a GIF of it. A surface seeds its own
fake data, starts its own throwaway server and writes the script.

The page runs on a virtual clock (Playwright's clock, with the page's CSS animations held and set by it) that moves
one frame at a time, and each frame is captured at 2x after the clock has moved, so a film is frame-exact at 30 or
60 fps however slow the box is: an animation, a scroll or typing moves exactly one frame's worth a frame, and a slow
capture only makes the render take longer. The cursor, the click ring and the camera are not in the page: each frame
records where they are, and encodeClip draws them over the capture in a compositor page before one near-lossless
encode of the image sequence; stitch makes the final encode. */
